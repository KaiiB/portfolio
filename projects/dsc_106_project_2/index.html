        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Title and Framing: Used "China Has Become the World's Largest Net CO2 Exporter" with emphasis on "Surpassing".
            Creates immediate negative framing while technically accurate.
            Alternative considered: neutral title like "CO2 Export Trends: China and USA".
            Chose dramatic framing to emphasize the crossover point, while also supporting the proposition.
            Only displayed relation between China and USA export emissions, but China still has the highest emissions overall.
            This could be misleading, as it implies that the USA is not a major contributor to CO2 emissions.
           (Score: -0.5)</li>
          <li>Color Scheme: Red for China, Blue for USA
            While following cultural conventions, avoids aggressive color saturations
            Could be seen as playing into stereotypes, but aids quick visual recognition.
            (Score: 1.5)
            </li>
          <li>Annotation Placement: Strategic placement of "2001: China Surpasses USA" with arrow.
            Provides clear context without overwhelming the visualization.
            Considered multiple annotations but kept it minimal for clarity. (Score: -0.5)</li>
            <li>Selection Bias: Purposely selected only China and USA to cross-visualize while 
            ignoring the relative emissions to all other countries \(or global proportion\). 
            Was done in order to support the primary proposition, but is still technically accurate (Score: -1)</li>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="./images/counter_proposition.png" alt="Counter Proposition" />
          <figcaption>Yearly change in carbon dioxide emissions from exports for the United States and China, from 1995 to 2021.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Derivative Deception: Purposely chose to plot the rate of change (discrete derivative AKA difference sequence). While
            not fabricated, it does not show the absolute values of the emissions, which could be misleading (and are in this case). Was done 
            in hopes of misguiding the reader to think that the emissions are relatively equal between the two countries, when in fact they are not. 
            By plotting the rate of change, we can show that the two countries follow similiar annual paterns: this is something with many confounds, 
            such as global events and natural occurences, so it doesn't actually disprove the proposition's argument among further analysis. (Score: -1.5)</li>
          <li>Smoothing Transformations: Used 3-year rolling average alongside raw data. Transparent about showing both smoothed and raw values, which 
            helps readers understand true trends while preserving data integrity. However, chose to bold the smoothed lines which could be misleading, but 
            regardless, both set of lines were accurate. (Score: 1)</li>
          <li>Title Framing: "Growth Rates Are Stabilizing" emphasizes recent convergence. Balances between highlighting positive development while 
            ommitting raw emission values. Could be seen as cherry-picking the stabilization narrative, which it is doing in reality. (Score: -0.5)</li>
            <li>Annotation Choice: "Near-Zero Growth Rate" annotation highlights convergence. Directs attention to key insight without distorting data.
                Considered more dramatic annotations but chose measured approach; however, near-zero keyword suggests equality. In reality, only the 
                growth rates approach convergence at zero, with China having their growth rates converge relatively faster (i.e. steeper gradients). (Score: 0.5)</li>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
        
        <p>The process of creating persuasive yet ethical visualizations revealed constant tension between highlighting specific narratives and 
            maintaining data integrity. The most challenging aspect was balancing propaganda-like elements without obvious red flags.
            For example, the decision to show both raw and smoothed data in the growth rate visualization emerged from this struggle: wanting to show trends 
            clearly while preserving transparency about the underlying data variation. 
        </p>
        <p>
        One thing that caught me off guard at first was how difficult it was to actually create a viable counter-proposition. Most relations between
        variables in the dataset were either too weak or too strong to be able to create a counter-proposition that was not misleading. If they were strong,
        the proposition would be almost impossible to refute, and if they were weak, both would be misleading. I had to resort to using the derivative of 
        the data in order to create a counter-proposition that was not misleading, but even then I had to examine correlations amongst countries in order 
        to selectively choose the two countries that I could best represent the counter-proposition with.
        </p>
        <p>
        What surprised me most was how subtle choices in framing, like title wording or annotation placement, can significantly impact perception without technically misrepresenting 
        data. I would now define ethical analysis and visualization as something that prioritizes transparency whilst acknowledging that perfect objectivity is impossible. 
        The key distinction between "acceptable" and "misleading" seems to lie in whether the choices made enhance understanding of true patterns in the data versus creating false 
        impressions through selective emphasis or omission. However, this boundary remains fuzzy and subjective, requiring omnipotent knowledge of the data and its context.
